Protect the Planet was the first game I've ever created on my own. It was for the Mini Game Jam 174 with the theme of defense. In the game, you play as a planet protecting yourself from rounds of incoming meteors with a gun. Between each round, you can upgrade your health, fire rate, and gun type. Your goal is to survive as long as you can.
